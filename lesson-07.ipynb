    "\n",
    "We'll step away from the UCI MLR mushroom dataset for a bit to deal with simpler numbers for this example. Suppose we have a collection 100 mushrooms. Half of these mushrooms (50) have bruises, and half (50) do not. Also, half of these mushrooms (50) are **edible** and half (50) are **poisonous**. A [**contingency table**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table) (also known as a **cross tabulation** or **crosstab**) is a matrix that displays the *multivariate* frequency distribution of the variables. Below is one possible **observed** contingency table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **edible**  | **e** | **p** | \n",
    "|-------------|-------|-------| \n",
    "| **bruises** |       |       |\n",

    "| **t**       |    30 |    20 |\n",

    "The **columns** of this contingency table correspond to edible (**e**) and poisonous (**p**) mushrooms, respectively. The **rows** correspond to the absence (**f**) or presence (**t**) of bruises on the mushroom, respectively. In this example, there are 20 edible mushrooms without bruises and 30 edible mushrooms with bruises. There are 30 poisonous mushrooms without bruises and 20 poisonous mushrooms with bruises.\n",

[Pearson's Chi-Squared Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test) is one way to predict how likely is the hypothesis that two features are independent. First, we need to compute the **expected** or **theoretical** contingency table for independent features. For example, what frequency of edible mushrooms with bruises would we expect from a set of 100 mushrooms where 50 are edible and 50 have bruises? We could compute this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{array}{c}\\text{Theoretical}\\\\\\text{frequency of}\\\\\\text{edible mushrooms}\\\\\\text{with bruises}\\end{array} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\text{Probability of}\\\\\\text{mushroom being}\\\\\\text{edible}\\end{array}\\right) \\times \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\text{Probability of}\\\\\\text{mushroom having}\\\\\\text{bruises}\\end{array}\\right) \\times\n",

    "| **t**       |    25 |    25 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the observed and expected frequencies, we can compute $\\chi^2$, the test-statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\chi^2=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{\\left(E_i-O_i\\right)^2}{E_i}}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "  - $\\chi^2$ is Pearson's cumulative test-statistic, which asymptotically approaches a [$\\chi^2$ distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution)\n",
    "  - $n$ is the number of cells in the contingency table (in our example, $n=4$)\n",
    "  - $E_i$ is the **expected** or **theoretical** frequency for the $i^{\\text{th}}$ cell of the contingency table.\n",
    "  - $O_i$ is the **observed** or **actual** frequency for the $i^{\\text{th}}$ cell of the contingency table.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The value of our $\\chi^2$ test-statistic is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi^2=\\frac{\\left(25-20\\right)^2}{25}+\\frac{\\left(25-30\\right)^2}{25}+\\frac{\\left(25-30\\right)^2}{25}+\\frac{\\left(25-20\\right)^2}{25}=4$$\n",

    "To determine whether a $\\chi^2$ test-statistic is statistically significant, we will also need to compute the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)\">**degrees of freedom**</a>, typically abbreviated as DoF or dof. For a feature with $N$ distinct classes, there are $N-1$ DoF. For example, there are 2 classes for the **bruises** feature: **t** or **f**, and hence only 1 DoF. To get the total DoF from multiple features, simply multiply the DoF for each feature: in our example, there is 1 DoF from the **bruises** feature and 1 DoF from the **edible** feature. The total DoF is simply $1\\times1=1$.\n",

    "One implication of the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) is that it's useful to reduce the dimensionality of sample sets, either to improve estimators’ accuracy scores or to boost their performance on very high-dimensional datasets. [The `feature_selection` module](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.feature_selection) in `sklearn` includes **univariate** filter selection methods, including [the `SelectKBest` class](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest.html). **Univariate** means that each feature is considered **independently** -- can you think of any pitfalls to univariate feature selection? (Hint: think about the XOR operator...)\n",

    "  - Features that are useful when combined (*e.g.* the XOR operator) would be ignored.\n",

    "An alternative approach would be to use [**recursive feature elimination (RFE)**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#rfe). With RFE, an estimator is first trained on the initial set of features. During the training step, weights are assigned to each feature. Next, features whose absolute weights are the **smallest** are pruned from the set. The idea is that the feature with the smallest absolute weight would change the model the least if it were removed from the set of features. This procedure is repeated until the desired number of features is reached.\n",

    "Let's take a peek in [the `sklearn` documentation for `RFE`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html). Note that the `estimator` parameter must have a `coef_` attribute that, after fitting with the `fit` method, holds the fitted parameters. More important features must correspond to higher absolute values of `coef_`. But alas, if we check the `RandomForestClassifier` documentation, there is no `coef_` attribute! However, there is a `feature_importances_` attribute that ranks the model features by importance. A simple adaptation, [suggested by user A.P. on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24123498/recursive-feature-elimination-on-random-forest-using-scikit-learn), shows how to make `RandomForestClassifier` compatible with `RFE`. **Run** the cell below to perform recursive feature elimination on the mushroom data set.

    "It turns out with this problem, we're in a bit of a funny edge case for `RFECV`. The `RandomForestClassifier` works so well that every model containg from 14 features up to 117 features gets a perfect cross-validation score! Most prediction problems would not be able to achieve a perfect cross-validation score even once, but the mushroom data set is a little too well-behaved. Ideally, in the event of a cross-validation score tie, we would want `RFECV` (a tool used for dimensionality reduction) to select the *fewest* number of features, and not the greatest. As of `sklearn` version 0.18.1, `RFECV` selects the model with the greatest number of features in the event of a tie -- hopefully this will be fixed in a later version.\n",

    "## Feature Selection - Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "So what feature selection techniques did we cover in this notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned about **univariate feature selection** and `SelectKBest()`. Univariate feature selection seems to be a computationally inexpensive way to pare down the dimensionality of a data set, but at the expense of missing out on features that work well in tandem. We needed a score function to determine the predictive power of each feature. For classification problems, we learned about the **Chi-Squared** $(\\chi^2)$ test statistic, which is one possible score function for `SelectKBest()`. As the value of $\\chi^2$ increases for a pair of features, it becomes less likely that the two features are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned about two ways to approach **recursive feature elimination**: `RFE()` and `RFECV()`. With the former (`RFE`), you need to prescribe *a priori* the number of features you'd like to retain for the final model. With the latter (`RFECV`), cross-validation scores are used to rank each number of features, and the final model will have a number of features that maximizes the cross-validation score. We saw that it's important that the fit estimator have some `coef_` attribute that contains a value for each feature, increasing with increasing feature importance. We also saw that RFE is a bit more computationally expensive than univariate feature selection. However, RFE generally yields better results than univariate feature selection for the same number of features, because RFE can capture more complex relationships (think XOR operator).\n",
    "\n",
    "For further reading on feature selection, you could check out the `sklearn.feature_selection` [userguide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#feature-selection) and [API](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.feature_selection), [this example](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/feature_selection/plot_rfe_with_cross_validation.html) of `RFE` from the `sklearn` documentation, and [this blogpost from machinelearningmastery](http://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-machine-learning-python/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to feature selection, you may also use **feature transformation** to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which we discussed in lesson-06-part-02."
