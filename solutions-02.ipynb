    "  - Introduce [the `pickle` module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html) from the Python Standard Library for preserving data structures in Python\n",
    "  - Practice loading data from different directories\n",
    "  - Review stacking and unstacking in `pandas` to [reshape a `DataFrame`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reshaping.html)\n",
    "  - Explore and understand data sets, particularly those with many missing values\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "  - You should be familiar with `pandas` (lesson 01 in the [ConnectIntensive repo](https://github.com/nickypie/ConnectIntensive))"

    "[Katie Malone](http://blog.udacity.com/2016/04/women-in-machine-learning-katie-malone.html) provides background on the Enron scandal, introduces the email corpus, defines a person-of-interest (POI), and poses an interesting ML question to motivate the project (\"Can we identify patterns in the emails of people who were POIs?\"). The videos provide excellent insight into the workflow for a Machine Learnist or Data Scientist.\n",

    "## In a `pickle`\n",
    "Suppose you're working with Python and you assemble nice data structures (*e.g.* dictionaries, lists, tuples, sets...) that you'll want to re-use in Python at a later time. [The `pickle` module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html) is a fast, efficient way to preserve (or pickle) those data structures without you needing to worry about how to structure or organize your output file. One nice thing about using `pickle` is that the data structures you store can be arbitrarily complex: you can have nested data structures (*e.g.* lists of tuples as the values in a dictionary) and `pickle` will know exactly how to serialize (or write) those structures to file! The next time you're in Python, you can un-pickle the data structures using `pickle.load()` and pick up right where you left off!\n",

Fortunately, it's just as easy to create a `DataFrame` object from a dictionary object: we could use [the method `pandas.DataFrame.from_dict()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.from_dict.html) or simply use [the constructor `pandas.DataFrame()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) -- either one works!\n",
